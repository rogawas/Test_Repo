How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

By comparing between two versions of my files I i found out the changes made between two files. This helped me to fix
errors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Changes made from file to file are easily tracked and it helps a lot in coding efficiently.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros is commit is in our control and we can make logical judgement of when to commit.
cons is if every coder has to to follow the same rules than 
training the resources is a big task.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

This is because if the project contains files which are interlinked and interdependent, it makes sense to commit all files together.This will improve efficiency.
